Seven Blessings! Welcome to my homepage. I am PhD Student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/) at [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) advised by [Prof. Vinay P. Namboodiri](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/vinaypn/). My research interests broadly include Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Video Processing and Reinforcement Learning. I completed my Masters in [Computer Science](http://cs.rkmvu.ac.in/) from [Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Educational and Reseach Institute](http://rkmvu.ac.in/) where I did my Masters Thesis under the supervision of [Dr. Tanmay Basu](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=utfyHkMAAAAJ&hl=en).
