abstract: The k-nearest neighbor decision rule is a simple,
robust and widely used classifier. The method puts a point
into a particular class, if the class has the maximum representation among the k nearest neighbors of the point in the
training set. However, determining the value of k is difficult.
Moreover, nearest neighbor classification techniques put
more stress on the data points that lie on the boundary
region of individual classes. These methods rely upon those
boundary points to decide the class label of a new data point,
but, the boundary points may not be a good representation of
a particular class. A method is thus proposed here in spirit of
the nearest neighbor classification technique using a medoid
based weighting scheme to overcome these limitations. The
experimental results using various standard benchmark data
sets have shown that the proposed method outperforms
different state of the art classifiers.
